# Age-Gender-Prediction

# 🧠 Human Age and Gender Prediction using Custom CNN

This project predicts **human age and gender** from facial images using a 
**custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and supports **real-time detection via OpenCV** in Google Colab.

---

## Features
- Custom CNN trained on UTKFace dataset  
- Dual output heads (Age regression + Gender classification)  
- Real-time camera demo (Open Cv)  
- Huber + Binary Crossentropy loss combo  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) used for evaluation

## Model Performance
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Gender Accuracy | ~90% |
| Age MAE | ±2–3 years |

---

## Tech Stack
TensorFlow • OpenCV • NumPy • Matplotlib • Pandas  

---

## How to Run
1. Open in Google Colab.
2. Mount your Drive and load the UTKFace dataset.
3. Run the notebook to train or predict age & gender.
